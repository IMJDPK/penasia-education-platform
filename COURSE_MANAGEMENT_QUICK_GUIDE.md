## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Using same course code** for different courses
2. **Forgetting to check "Active"** (course won't show!)
3. **Setting fee to 0** for paid courses
4. **Copying course content** from other websites (copyright!)
5. **Deleting courses** with enrollments (use deactivate instead)

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. Use unique course codes (BUS101, BUS102, etc.)
2. Always check "Active" for new courses
3. Set correct fees in HKD
4. Write original descriptions
5. Deactivate courses instead of deleting

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Course code already exists"
**Solution:** Each course needs a unique code. Try:
- BUS101 → BUS102
- CUL-BASIC → CUL-BASIC-2

### Problem: "Course not showing on website"
**Solution:** Check these:
1. Is "Active" checked? ✓
2. Did you click "Create Course"? ✓
3. Did you see success message? ✓
4. Try refreshing the courses page

### Problem: "Can't delete course"
**Solution:** Course has enrollments or applications
- Option 1: Deactivate instead (uncheck "Active")
- Option 2: Wait until semester ends
- Option 3: Contact IT admin

### Problem: "CEF fee field not showing"
**Solution:** Check the "CEF Eligible" checkbox first
- The CEF fee field appears automatically when checked

### Problem: "Students seeing wrong fee"
**Solution:** Two fee fields:
- "Course Fee" = What students pay
- "CEF Fee" = After reimbursement (if eligible)
